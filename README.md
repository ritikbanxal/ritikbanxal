# Hey there 👋

I'm Ritik, a software engineer based in Germany.

I mostly work on frontend stuff — React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and a bit of animation with Framer Motion.

I also use Figma for UI design and Procreate when I want to sketch ideas.

This is a fresh profile where I'll be uploading some smaller projects, experiments, and things I'm currently working on. Everything here is built from scratch, no copy/paste templates.
