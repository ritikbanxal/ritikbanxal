# Hey there 👋

I'm Ritik, a full stack developer based in Germany.

I work across the entire stack — from building interfaces with React and TypeScript to developing robust APIs and managing databases.

I also use Figma for UI design and Procreate when I want to sketch out system architectures or ideas.

This is a fresh profile where I'll be uploading some smaller projects, experiments, and things I'm currently working on. Everything here is built from scratch, no copy/paste templates.
